# MoneyManager
A simple money manager using classes and interfaces.
It currently contains one business class and one editor class. I made it a while ago while reading C# The Yellow Book. 
I may expand it in the future to contain some inheritance.Take a look if you're a beginner looking for some easy to understand code :)
